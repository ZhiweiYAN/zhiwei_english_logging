What is the single most precious commodity in Westen society? Money? Status?
I would argue it is time.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item CAPTCHA: The Ultimate Time-Waster, any system that forces the user to prove they are human.
    \item Why Are Password So Complicated: Can't we come up with a better solution than an arcane mix of uppercase, numbers and symbols? complexicity and long phrase.
    \item Don't Make Users Correct 'Their' Mistakes in Forms. Sometimes we even waste the user's time when we are trying to help them. Forms are paticularly painful on touchscreens.
    \item Pay Special Attention To Repetitive Tasks. For that matter, a more robust solution to 'Remember me' functionality would be nice, so that users are, in fact, remembered.
    \item Help Users Process Our Content Faster: We can also make our content a lot more scannable, with better use of headings, pullout quotes and lists.
\end{enumerate}
